<h1> Partner, lets think about this...</h1>


<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p> No signs of forced entry, Alice knew the attacker and let her into her home.<br> They had a drink together, then a fight broke out. <br>It looks like Alice was wounded, but was able to make her way to the bedroom where she had a landline on her side table. <br>She tried to call for help, but then the assailant stabbed her with the murder weapon into her back, ending her life.</p>

<h3>What does the evidence show?</h3>
<p> Based on the broken table, the victim was most likely thrown into it during the fight, but i'm interested in whats surrounding it. I think I see a piece of paper, no a photograph. Two young girls posing together, looks like it could be Alice and her sister. Is there someone in the background? Too blurry to tell.</p>
<p> The wine glasses, the lipstick. There is no lipstick on the victim. Perhaps another woman? None of the women I interviewed tonight </p>
