<p> There are five suspects, one of them has to be the killer</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert(`I talked with her just a few hours ago on the phone, Alice said she had to go and couldn't talk, and before she hung up, I think I heard the doorbell ring. She didn't mention anyone coming over, but she wouldn't just let anyone in her house and if she thought she was in any danger she would have told me, I'm sure. Alice was my best friend, my sister, I just can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt her, she's always been the smart, pretty, most liked sister, never needed any makeup, had no trouble getting a full ride to University and had dozens of friends. Our parents are gonna be crushed, I guess I'm their only child now.`)">Vanessa: Younger sister</button>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert(`Okay, I don't know much and i'm not one to gossip, but... It's gotta be the husband, I heard they were having troubles at home, I mean where was he when it happened? It was late at night and shouldn't he have been home? Isn't that suspicious? And don't tell me he was working late either, I know he lost his job weeks ago. That's why Alice has been working so hard lately, gunning for the top spot, we both were, but she was a shoo-in she had a really good relationship with the boss man, if you know what I mean. Her husband must have caught on and was so angry, he killed her. I mean, that's what I think, but like I said, I'm not one to gossip. `)">Cynthia: Coworker</button>
