<p> There are five suspects, one of them has to be the killer</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert(`I talked with her just a few hours ago on the phone, Alice said she had to go and couldn't talk, and before she hung up, I think I heard the doorbell ring. She didn't mention anyone coming over, but she wouldn't just let anyone in her house and if she thought she was in any danger she would have told me, I'm sure. Alice was my best friend, my sister, I just can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt her, she's always been the smart, pretty, most liked sister, never needed any makeup, had no trouble getting a full ride to University and had dozens of friends. Our parents are gonna be crushed, I guess I'm their only child now.`)">Vanessa: Younger sister</button>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert(`Okay, I don't know much and i'm not one to gossip, but... It's gotta be the husband, I heard they were having troubles at home, I mean where was he when it happened? It was late at night and shouldn't he have been home? Isn't that suspicious? And don't tell me he was working late either, I know he lost his job weeks ago. That's why Alice has been working so hard lately, gunning for the top spot, we both were, but she was a shoo-in she had a really good relationship with the boss man, if you know what I mean. Her husband must have caught on and was so angry, he killed her. I mean, that's what I think, but like I said, I'm not one to gossip. `)">Cynthia: Coworker</button>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert(` Where was I? I was working late. What? How do you know about that?? Cynthia told you? I swear that woman doesn't know how to keep her mouth shut. Ugh the whole city probably knows that I can't keep a job. I swear when I see her again... Anyway, I wasn't working, I was at the bar. It's been impossible to find a job and I just needed to get my mind off of it. I figured Alice would be out with her sister or something, I thought she mentioned that. But I swear I wasn't home and I don't know who could have done this to her. I don't know what I'm gonna do maybe sell the house and move out of here. I never liked this city anyway. `)">Troy: Husband</button>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert(`I don't know why you guys are talking to me. I haven't seen Alice since high school. You went through her phone? Okay yeah, we spoke recently, but it was just the basic stuff you say to someone after a long time. Say you miss eachother, say you'll get together soon. It never really happens. Yeah we planned on meeting today, but I never actually was going to go through with it. I didn't want to see her again, I was just being polite. If that's a crime you can take me in right now, but if not, I'd like to leave. Thank you.`)">Tracy: High School Friend</button>
