    <h2>Good thing you're here, you're the best detective in town. If anyone is going to solve this case, it's you.</h2>

    <p>
     You walk into the living room and you see a cigar still burning, the table is shattered, and the fireplace is burning, but it's the middle of summer. There are streaks of blood on the floor, leading to the bedroom. Two half-drunk glasses of alcohol, one with lipstick on the rim.  What took place here tonight?
    </p>

    <h3> Let's begin the investigation.</h3>
