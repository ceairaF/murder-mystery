The wounds on her hands suggest she put up a fight, we'll see if we can pull up any DNA from the fingernails, in the mean time, I believe the cause of death is from this wound in her abdomen. The weapon entered through the back and then exited through the front of her body. Something sharp and cylindrical inserted with brute force.`)">Talk to the coroner</button>
